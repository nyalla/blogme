Hello everyone, we all come up with a situation where we need to send a message via whatsapp for onetime. The main prerequisite is to save the number in contacts first then we used to send a message. Often it is frustrating to save in contact for just one time message.

So I was searching online how to do this without saving a number in contacts. I got some info on whatsapp APIs and its like more of typing a URL and add phonenumber to it. But saving a phonenumber is easier than typing a url with new number everytime.

So I made a small hack to it and deployed in github pages. All you need to do is go to this url and give phone number and message and click on the Button.

Now your whatsapp will automatically open chat with given phone number and message.

Hope you will like it.

Note: Give the phone number with country code.
